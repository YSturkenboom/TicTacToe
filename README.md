# TicTacToe v2.0

![Screenie](/screenie.png)

## "It's tic-tac-toe, but everything is an explosion"

Everyone knows tic-tac-toe. And honestly it's a bit boring. You know what isn't boring? Explosions.

## Usage

Play against the AI, with a friend, or even against yourself!
Just start a game by tapping a square to place your explosion. After that, the other player may tap a square to place theirs.
If a player gets three explosions in a row, horizontal, diagonal or vertical, they win and are crowned the *Demolition Expert*.

The game starts in 1vAI mode by default. If you want to change modes, just tap the corresponding buttons in the action bar
for some fresh explodey fun.
