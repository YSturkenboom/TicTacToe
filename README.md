# TicTacToe v1.1

## "It's tic-tac-toe, but everything is an explosion"

Everyone knows tic-tac-toe. And honestly it's a bit boring. You know what isn't boring? Explosions.

## Usage

Play with a friend, or against yourself.
Just start a game by tapping a square to place your explosion. After that, the other player may tap a square to place theirs.
If a player gets three explosions in a row, horizontal, diagonal or vertical, they win and are crowned the *Demolition Expert*.

You can reset the board for some fresh explodey fun by hitting the reset button in the top action bar.
